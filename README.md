## Usage
`python parseMonthlySales.py` will take **any** raw Amazon/Ebay/Walmart/ShipStation spreadsheet exports in the **SpreadsheetExports** folder and parse them. The resulting files will be created in the **output** folder. Each output will be a csv, with a name corresponding to the particular marketplace, todays date and will include only sales, for a particular SKU for the current month.
  
`python OrderAnalysis.py` will take **one** ShipStation csv spreadsheet, in the same directory [as itself] and will remove all extraneous columns except ones pertaining to analysing sales and returns. ie: `python OrderAnalysis.py sales` will  output a trimmed csv which has columns like order date, order number, **cost of shipping**, item description, SKU, etc... where as `python OrderAnalysis.py returns` will perform the same function, but will output different columns relating to returns [manual orders export].

**Requirements:** None
* **output** and **SpreadsheetExports** folders are required and hardcoded. Can easily be changed or made to disclude.
* System agnostic. All imported libraries are native to default python installation. (ie: `os, csv, datetime`)  

## What?
**Gather month to date eCommerce sales, for only specified products/skus.**
* Strip out any csv rows, line items, that are prior to current month or are not associated with desired product.
* Output the remaining rows (**matching** items) to an output csv that retains format/header of the original marketplace export.
* Add spreadsheet functions (xlsx/gsheets) to dynamic column, standard math for spreadsheet reference.

## Why?
**Reliable weekly sales reports. Despite each eCommerce platform using different export conventions.**
* Reliable sales. It's easy to mixup which **correct** indexes need to be added, ignored, multiplied, etc...
* See '**TODO**'
* Each eCommerce platform exports their sales in a different way and has it's own pros/cons when assessing.
    - Amazon/Walmart allow export of all sales in 30/60/90 day incriments (across months)
    - Ebay allows for scheduled export within a **range** of dates. Dates often times different from Amazon/Walmart, above.
      * eBay exports also has duplicate line item entries when one order consists of multiple items. (archaic)
    - ie: Shipstation records true shipping cost, whereas other marketplaces have 'Free Shipping' recorded.
* Total sales 'GUI' metrics aren't always reliable, sometimes are too general and/or don't offer filtering of sales.

## TODO
* ~~Finish ship station function --> Add =SUM spread functs~~
* ~~Pythonically add up totals of a column. Then output dictionary of {eBay: $TotalSales, Amazon: $X} to log file for easy (no gsheet/xlsx) reference~~
* Add sys.argv[1] input to specify SKU prefix that gets parsed
  * Not needed but would remove personalized, hardcoded 'LUM' SKU prefix.
  * Incorporate tarps when finalizing Nov.  
* **Add shipstation/shipping cost feature.**
  * Match order number, append shipping cost index to index's row.
  * Purpose of this repo is based on 'whim' of bosses. This feature would add usefulness to more people.
* ~~Create windows binary~~
* **Add Sales Tax feature**
  * If sys.argv[2] == 'salestax' then if salestax index != None, append row to SalesTax-Month.csv
